# # Call Centre Performance & Debt-Recovery Effectiveness Analysis
#
# ## 1. Business Problem
# The organisation is experiencing inconsistent call-centre performance, leading to long handling times, low first-contact resolution, poor customer satisfaction, and inefficient use of staff. In addition, agents show varying ability to recover outstanding debt and negotiate realistic, sustainable payment plans, resulting in high rates of broken arrangements, repeat contact, and unresolved arrears.
#
# ## 2. Core Objectives
# The primary goal is to transform raw operational data into actionable insights. The project aims to:
# *   **Improve Service Quality:** Reduce call times, increase first-contact resolution, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
# *   **Boost Financial Performance:** Increase the effectiveness of debt recovery and design more sustainable payment plans to improve cash flow.
# *   **Enhance Operational Visibility:** Equip managers with data-driven tools to understand root causes, monitor agent performance, and implement targeted coaching.
# *   **Ensure Compliance:** Identify and support vulnerable customers effectively, ensuring adherence to regulatory standards.
#
# ## 3. Key Business Questions
# To achieve these objectives, the analysis will focus on answering the following:
# *   What operational factors drive long calls and repeat contact?
# *   Which agent behaviours and negotiation styles correlate with successful outcomes?
# *   What customer or account characteristics predict successful debt repayment?
# *   Why are payment plans failing and how can their sustainability be improved?
# *   How can we optimise staffing, call routing, and agent coaching with data?
#
# ## 4. Target Solution & Analytical Approach
# The proposed solution is to develop a comprehensive analytics framework by:
# *   **Integrating Data:** Consolidate disparate data from telephony, CRM, collections, QA, and customer feedback systems into a single source of truth.
# *   **Building Predictive Models:** Create models to forecast the likelihood of successful debt repayment and identify accounts at high risk of repeat contact or default.
# *   **Developing Dashboards:** Design and deploy interactive dashboards for leadership. These tools will provide clear, real-time insights into performance drivers, enabling early intervention and effective agent coaching.
#
# ## 5. Measures of Success
# The success of this project will be measured by quantifiable improvements in:
# *   **Efficiency Metrics:** Reduction in Average Handle Time (AHT) and increase in First Contact Resolution (FCR).
# *   **Financial Metrics:** Increase in total debt recovered and a reduction in the rate of broken payment arrangements.
# *   **Customer Metrics:** Improvement in Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores.
